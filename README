NAME

    CGI::Session::ID::MD5_Base32 - CGI::Session ID driver based on Base32
    encoding

SYNOPSIS

        use CGI::Session;

        $session = new CGI::Session("id:MD5_Base32", undef, { Directory => '/tmp' };

DESCRIPTION

    CGI::Session::ID::MD5_Base32 is to generate MD5 digest Base32 encoded
    random ids. The library does not require any arguments.

     There are two reasons why to use it
      - shorter string result
      - case insensibility

    ( both very usefull for user login and other similar purposes, keyboard
    inputs, email contained codes, etc... )
